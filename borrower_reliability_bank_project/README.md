# Borrower Reliability - Bank Data Analysis

## Project Overview
The project aims to investigate whether a client's marital status and the number of children they have influence their ability to repay a loan on time. The input data comes from the bank and consists of statistics on clients' creditworthiness.

The results of this research will be utilized in building a credit scoring model, a specialized system that assesses a potential borrower's ability to repay a loan to the bank.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are to:

1. Determine the impact of a client's family status on their loan repayment behavior.
2. Investigate whether the number of children a client has affects their loan repayment.
3. Provide insights and findings that can be used to enhance the bank's credit scoring model.

## Research Process
The research process includes the following steps:

### 1. Data Overview
   - Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and content.
   
### 2. Data Preprocessing
   - Preprocessing and cleaning the data to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
   
### 3. Data Analysis
   - Analyzing the data to identify correlations between family status, the number of children, and loan repayment behavior.
   
### 4. Conclusion and Recommendations
   - Summarizing the research findings and providing recommendations for the bank's credit scoring model.

## Libraries Used
